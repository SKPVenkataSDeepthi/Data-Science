# Data Collection & Preparation 
### 1. Data Science Process
* Stages: Obtaining data → Cleaning & Wrangling → Exploratory Analysis → Prediction & Interpretation.
* Example: A company like Netflix collects user viewing history, cleans it by removing duplicates, and analyzes patterns to recommend content.

### 2. ETL (Extract-Transform-Load)
* Extract: Gathering data from sources like databases, web logs, or APIs.
* Transform: Converting data into usable formats, e.g., changing date formats.
* Load: Storing it in databases like SQL, NoSQL, or Hadoop.
* Example: A retailer extracts sales data from multiple stores, converts currencies, and loads it into a data warehouse.

### 3. Data Provenance & Metadata
* Metadata tracks data origin and transformations, helping with error detection.
* Example: A medical study logs when, where, and how patient data was recorded.

### 4. Data Wrangling (Cleaning & Structuring)
* Steps: Discover → Structure → Clean → Enrich → Validate → Publish.
* Example: Airbnb collects listings data, removes duplicate entries, and standardizes location details.

### 5. Data Sources Across Sectors
* Business: Excel, SQL, BI tools.
* Programming: Web scraping, APIs, pandas.
* Enterprise: Oracle, IBM DB2.
* Web Companies: Hadoop, Spark, Flume.
* Example: Facebook processes billions of user interactions stored in Hadoop.

### 6. Handling Dirty Data
* Issues: Incomplete, duplicated, or incorrect data.
* Example: An e-commerce platform finds customers with different addresses in separate databases and merges the records.

### 7. Web Scraping & APIs
* Web scraping extracts data from web pages, while APIs provide structured access.
* Example: A finance app pulls real-time stock prices via APIs from Nasdaq.

### 8. Data Storage & Integration
* Challenges: Different formats, missing fields, and outdated records.
* Example: A weather forecasting system integrates data from IoT sensors, satellites, and historical records.
* By following these principles, data scientists ensure high-quality, useful data for analysis and decision-making.
