# Time Series Analysis

This repository is dedicated to time series analysis and forecasting techniques. It includes various tools and methods for analyzing time series data, such as decomposition into trend, seasonal, and residual components.

## Overview

- **Data**: Contains sample datasets used for demonstrating time series analysis techniques. These datasets can be used for testing and exploring different methods.

- **Scripts**: Includes Python scripts for performing time series analysis. These scripts cover tasks such as decomposing time series data, applying different models, and generating visualizations.

- **Notebooks**: Provides Jupyter notebooks that offer interactive demonstrations and explorations of time series analysis methods. These notebooks serve as a practical guide for understanding and applying different techniques.

- **Results**: Stores the output from various analyses, including visualizations and plots generated from the scripts and notebooks. This folder helps track and review the results of different time series analyses.

## Getting Started

1. **Setup**:
   - Ensure you have the necessary Python packages installed.
    
2. **Analysis**:
   - Use the scripts or Jupyter notebooks to perform time series analysis on your data. The provided tools cover decomposition, forecasting, and visualization of time series data.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Check the results for output plots and analysis results. These visualizations will help you understand the underlying patterns in your time series data.
